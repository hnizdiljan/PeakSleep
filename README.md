# Peak Sleep

## Overview
Peak Sleep is a Garmin Connect IQ widget that helps you determine how much sleep you need to fully recharge your Body Battery. The application uses your current Body Battery level, heart rate, and resting heart rate to estimate the amount of sleep needed to reach a 100% Body Battery.

## Features
- **Current Metrics Display**: Shows your current Body Battery level and heart rate
- **Sleep Time Estimation**: Calculates how many hours and minutes of sleep you need to fully recharge
- **Personalized Calculations**: Takes into account your resting heart rate (RHR) and current heart rate to adjust sleep estimates
- **Customizable Recharge Rate**: Allows you to set your personal Body Battery recharge rate through app settings

## How It Works
1. The widget reads your current Body Battery level from your Garmin device
2. It calculates how many Body Battery points you need to reach 100%
3. Based on your configured recharge rate and current physiological state, it estimates the sleep time needed
4. The estimate is displayed in hours and minutes

## Settings
- **Recharge Rate**: You can adjust the base recharge rate (points per hour) through the Connect IQ app settings. Default is 11.0 points per hour.

## Supported Devices
The app is compatible with most Garmin devices that support Connect IQ 3.0 and higher and have Body Battery functionality, including:
- Fenix 6/7/8 series
- Forerunner 245, 945
- Venu, Venu 2
- Vivoactive 4
- And other compatible devices

## Installation
1. Download the app from the Garmin Connect IQ Store
2. Sync your device with Garmin Connect
3. The widget will appear in your widgets list on your device

## Tips for Use
- Check the widget before bed to know how much sleep you need
- The estimated sleep time adjusts based on your current heart rate relative to your resting heart rate
- If your Body Battery is already at 100%, the widget will display "Full"
- If Body Battery data is unavailable, the widget will display "N/A"
